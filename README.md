# VNCAuthTest
It test whether your password can access remote VNC server. 

For now it only includes a script for Security Type: VNC Authentication. 
Stay tuned for more types support.

It requires `python3` and `pycryptodome`.

You need a `pw.txt`, maybe refer to [PasswordDic](https://github.com/k8gege/PasswordDic).
